# 2D Character Animation Game

## Overview
This is a simple 2D character animation game created with Python and the Pygame Zero (`pgzrun`) library. The game features a character that can walk left and right across the screen based on the player's input. This project demonstrates basic character animation and movement control in a 2D game environment.

## Features
- **Directional Movement**: Use the right and left arrow keys to move the character.
- **Character Animation**: Smooth animation with multiple frames to simulate walking.
- **Flip Effect**: The character changes direction when moving left or right, giving a realistic movement effect.

## Controls
- **Right Arrow Key**: Moves the character to the right, facing forward.
- **Left Arrow Key**: Moves the character to the left, with the character's face turning in that direction.
